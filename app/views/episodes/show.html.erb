  <!-- the code above ^^^ was me finishing but working my way to getting the right ID to interprolate into the link/route to make it work properly if I had more time I would've cracked it-->
</ul>
<%= link_to 'Edit', edit_appearance_path %>
  <!-- the code above sorta of works in the sense that it will take you to an edit form where you can edit any appearance however whenever you get passed a certain amount of ID's (like guests passed ID's with 7 or so... there is no appearances yet that match that ID)-->
